# Inclusive App Design

## Statistics on inclusiveness
67% apps are sold internationally
285 million people are blind (half the population of the USA)
Over 1 billion people have a disability, worldwide.

## Typography
Ways to indicate hierarchy: size, margins, weight, color, decorations (italics, underline, etc.), capitalisation…
Notice that some languages make no difference between upper and lowercase and stuff (many non-latin scripts do not). Some of them also have NO italic appearance.
Some scripts aren’t compatible with some font weights either.
Some scripts are also more dense and therefore you shouldn’t make text-sizes to small.

## Dynamic Layouts
Layouts need to be dynamic to be compatible with taller scripts.
Many languages take up way more characters than than English.
People expect to see larger or smaller font sizes when they specify a dynamic type in their settings, so your apps should show them too.
Try to support text styles, because you get all dynamic functionality for free.
Support standard layout margins to be consistent with the system and other apps.
By using leading and trailing constraints you’ll support right-to-left languages.

## Color
Blue might be the most popular color around the world.
Green and red share the second spot.

What are the associations?
Blue: the sky, short wavelength
Green: nature and safety (traffic lights)
Red: symbol of revolution and conflict, suites passion and love (in China associated with Lunar Year)

1 in 12 men and 1 in 200 women are colorblind.

Contrast is important in your app, it’s important that luminosities of contrasting colors are far away from each other relative to the spectrum. To quickly check luminosity, set your Photoshop document on grayscale and you can check contrast more clearly. Always go for the highest contrast ratio.

You shouldn’t rely solely on color to communicate functions of shapes.


## Iconography
Symbols can have cultural norms.
Avoid direction and text in your icons.
Iconography should match UI if applicable.
