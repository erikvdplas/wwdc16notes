# Typography and Fonts

## SF Mono
San Francisco Mono is a new font included with Xcode with equal width characters, along all weights. 
Italic is available.
SF Mono supports many scripts.

## Text
Text is made out of characters, which are represented in a font file by glyphs.
Sometimes a font also carries typographic features like ligatures or special characters.
A typeface is not the same as a font, a typeface is the DNA or structure of a font.

## Tracking
Tracking is global kerning (distance between glyphs).

## Legibility
Legibility is about distinguishing glyphs, scale and distance affects this.
Legibility is also important for layouts and glyph design.

## Voice
A font voice is about the feeling a font communicates.

## Density
Density is about whitespace, glyphs shouldnâ€™t lack it.
